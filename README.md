# 🌿 Ferna  
*A smarter, open-source way to care for your plants.*

## 🌱 Why Ferna?

This started because I couldn’t keep a cactus alive — and I wanted something better to help.

I built Ferna as a tool I could run myself, tweak if I needed to, and trust to do one thing well. Hopefully, it’s something that can help others too — especially anyone who just wants a simple, solid way to take better care of their plants.

It’s open source because I believe tools like this should be. It’s designed to grow slowly and improve over time, shaped by people who care about plants and thoughtful software.
